# Coursera Developing Data Products Week 3 Peer-graded Assignment: Plotly

In this project, we created a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly, representing the number of road accidents in Great Britain from 2005 to 2015, grouped by severity (slight, serious, or fatal).



The source data sets are not included in this repository. To reproduce this presentation, you will need to download the zipped [All STATS19 data (accident, casualties and vehicle tables) for 2005 to 2014](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data/resource/8ecee6ac-33fd-4f5b-8973-e900cc65d24a) and [Road Safety - Accidents 2015](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data/resource/ceb00cff-443d-4d43-b17a-ee13437e9564) data sets, and then extract the `Accidents0514.csv` and `Accidents_2015.csv` files from these zip files in a subdirectory named `data`.
